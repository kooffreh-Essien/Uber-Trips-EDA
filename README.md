# Uber Trips Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Introduction
The aim of this project is to carryout an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
on an Uber trips dataset from New York to derive insights and patterns on
which day(s) have the highest and the lowest trips or the busiest hour. 
New York has a highly complex transportation system coupled with a large residential populace.

# Data Sourcing
The dataset used for this project was gotten from Kaggle.

# Data Transformation
- The dataset had some missing values (NaN), so I had to drop them.
- I renamed the column headers foe easy referencing.
- The Start_date and End_start was split into Hour, Day, Day of the week, month and weekday.

# Findings and Recommendation
- In conclusion, this analysis has pointed out  important insights such as locations, and daytimes where there are high number of trips.

- We recommend that, Uber needs to station or contract more drivers within Cary city to minimize waiting times, especially within the hours of 1pm - 4pm; hence, boosting customer satisfaction.

- For locations with very little patronage like Gampaha, Latta, and Briar Meadows, Uber can attempt to run marketing campaigns within those catchments.
